                <h5>Teamwork, Multilingual, Leadership, Problem Solving</h5>
                <p> I have obtained teamwork skills working on assignments and projects throughout my
                    course, working with a variety of different people.
                    Throughout my life I have acquired multiple languages which have aided me in my communication
                    skills (English, Arabic, Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian, French, Irish).
                    Working in teams has led me to further develop my leadership skills, as a leader in a group project
                    I find the strengths and weaknesses of my teammates and give them the tasks that they would
                    excel in while
                    also giving them challenges to further their knowledge and skills.
                    I have further developed my problem-solving skills by observing, analyzing
                    and
                    making
                    design decisions on my second-year project. I have also developed problem-solving skills in
                    other
                    aspects, for
                    example working on the design and building of a chicken/pigeon coop.

                    <h4>Workday</h4>
                </a>
                <p>
                    I undertook my work experience as an intern at Workday.
                    My role within Workday was Application Developer/Software Application Engineer in Time management
                    or more specifically Absence. My role involved working as part of a Scrum team to develop features
                    that will
                    be useful to Workday customers. This involved taking a project and coming up with smaller more
                    manageable tasks
                    so that we can achieve our end goal, which is to release features requested by Workday customers.
                </p>

                <p>At the beginning of my internship, I was assigned a project that I would work on for the duration of
                    my internship.
                    The project was a highly requested feature by Workday customers, it was a button that would help
                    decrease the amount of
                    clicks a user had to click and make the process more intuitive to all users. Before my changes when
                    a user would try deleting
                    an approved Time Off, they would have to select each day and correct the quantity to zero or
                    manually click on the minus icon to
                    remove each entry in the event. This is not very intuitive, so my changes would make it so that the
                    user would only need to select the
                    band that contains the entries and click on the Delete Request button to remove the approved Time
                    off, I also needed to be sure that
                    it worked in both the Time Off calendar and the Absence calendar.

                <p>I created an interactive dashboard that takes the user through Homicide in the USA and how factors
                    such as age, race, sex and gender can have an impact
                    and the document details ways that may be effective in predicting homicides and preventing them.
